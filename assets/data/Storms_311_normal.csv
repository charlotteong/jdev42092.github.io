The Boston Transportation Department (BTD) has allowed the contractor to work nights as long as there is no loud noise after 11pm.     By working at night  the work can be done much faster    If any work does happen after 11pm the case should be referred to BTD Permit division.

Closed date : 2018-02-06 09:15:26.843 Case Resolved Dear Constituent     The Boston Public Works Department Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) has identified the unacceptable patch as belonging to National Grid.    Because the bad patch is not a public safety issue National Grid has been notified that they will have one week  to make the repair.    If this patch is not repaired within one week we will hold up National Grid permits until the job is done.    The CIU has added the location to its data base that tracks unacceptable utility work.    The CIU will monitor the progress of the work. The City apologizes for the inconvenience for this necessary work.

Under this system it is possible to provide longer ""Walk"" times and shorter delays to vehicles and pedestrians.  During the green light for vehicles ""Walk"" signals are on for pedestrians crossing parallel to the flow of traffic.  Under this system turning traffic must yield to pedestrians.  We have verified that signs are in place directing turning traffic to yield to pedestrians and additional signs are provided to warn pedestrians to watch for turning vehicles.

Closed date : 2018-02-01 08:06:25.44 Case Resolved   Dear Constituent     The Boston Public Works Construction Inspection Unit (CIU) Inspector has identified that vault on the sidewalk needing attention as the responsibility of Eversource Electric.     Replacing or repairing vaults is not an easy repair.      Eversource has to have the vaults custom made for each separate location.      This takes time.  In addition the construction itself is technical and involved  as well as expensive.     We have informed Eversource Electric that they have to set aside resources to repair vaults around the City.    The estimated time for replacement is 6-9 months.      However  we will require Eversource to make a temporary repair such as the use of asphalt  especially if it is a major tripping hazard.     The temporary repair should be done within 3 business days.

Closed date : 2018-02-06 17:45:54.013 Case Noted The restriping of Beacon Street was implemented as part of the City's Vision Zero program with the principle goals of reducing motorist speeds  providing greater safety in pedestrian crossings  and delineating a better protected space for cyclists to use the corridor.  Because there is more roadway width on Beacon Street than is needed to process the volumes of vehicles present  the extra space was converted into a bicycle lane and additional buffers for pedestrians.   We do understand that the changes to the roadway are not commonly experienced in the City just yet  and we are asking all users (cyclists included) to be considerate and conscientious while making use of the street. Flyers have been distributed to buildings along Beacon Street and two information signs were hung up along each block in order to assist motorists and cyclists in knowing where they should be and how they should be using the various spaces in the street.  I would certainly say that it was not appropriate for that individual to have yelled at you. Perhaps a clarifying conversation with you might have been more constructive  especially between two persons representing different transportation modes. Less yelling  more speaking  is my thought.  The pavement markings installed as part of this change provide a parking lane of 8.5 feet  an additional passenger side buffer of 3 feet  and a bike lane of 6 feet. The additional space allocated to the parking lane  which are normally 7-7.5 feet  was intended to provide a bit more room for motorists to park appropriately and comfortably in the lane.  The buffer of 3 feet is intended to provide persons with a standing space between the vehicle parking lane and the bicycle lane.  This space is designed to be where doors may be opened  groceries and packages taken out  and/or a place to safely stand to wait before crossing the bicycle lane.  The loading/drop-off zone signed in front of #330 Beacon Street was retained by request of the nearby residents. This does continue to designate the two-vehicle space between the signs for this use. However  this designation affects the area within the parking lane away from the curb. The loading zone and the bicycle lane do not merge  but are positioned in parallel to one another.   As they would on the driver?s side of the vehicle with the travel lane  it is the responsibility of the driver/passenger(s) to be conscientious about any cyclists approaching in the bike lane.  However  it is absolutely a courteous and collaborative progress toward cultivating safe and low-speed use of our City fabric for cyclists to make efforts to yield if a pedestrian were trying to cross the lane to the sidewalk.  The bicycle lane is to be treated as a standard vehicle lane on the roadway.  In our dense urban environment  cyclists yielding to persons making deliveries or drop-offs at this space is a considerate and safe maneuver  but not a requirement. The buffer installed between the parking areas and the bike lane is intended to provide space for standing while the interaction is navigated carefully.  It should also be emphasized that we regularly recommend that cyclists monitor and moderate their speeds of travel  especially when the context area is designed more for people than vehicles. While much less dangerous than speeding behaviors by motorists  a cyclist moving along at a significant speed does create an environment of anxiety for and risk of collision with pedestrians. This relationship is not conducive to the partnership that cyclists and pedestrians should have together  as they are both relatively vulnerable roadway users when compared with motor vehicles. ,BTDT: Comment,Mayor's 24 Hour Hotline,Employee & General Comments,General Comments For a Program or Policy,BTDT,Constituent Call,Normal,2018-01-27, ,42.3594,-71.0587
