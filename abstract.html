	<p>In the past several years, extreme weather events, particularly winter storms, have
	hit Boston. In response, communication from weather advisories, public service suspensions,
	and municipal responses has moved from more traditional networks to social ones- particularly
	Twitter. While Twitter has branded itself as a platform of social democracy, prior research
	has shown that there are significant gaps in representation of both users and tweets relating
 	to historically underserved communities. It is critical to identify these gaps, known as data shadows,
	in order to equitably serving all communities in the city.</p>

	<p>We are interested in studying Twitter conversations, key users, and trending topics related
	to four recent winter storms: 2018 Bombogenesis, 2015 Winter Storm Juno, 2015 Winter Marcus, and 2013
 	Winter Storm Nemo. In mapping networks of users and tweets, both through force-directed graphs and
 	maps of the city, we hope to understand whether city residents are being equally included in alerts
	and online requests for service provision. We plan on comparing Twitter conversations to requests made
	to the city's 311 service (via phone calls, Tweets, and through the 311 mobile app) to see if current
	preferences towards social media engagement are privileging certain city residents over others.</p>
