	<!-- create a paragraph -->
	<p>In the pass several years, extreme weather events, particularly winter storms, have
	hit Boston. In response, communication of weather advisories, public service suspensions,
	and municipal responses have moved from more traditional networks to social ones- particularly
	Twitter. While Twitter has branded itself as a platform of social democracy, prior research
	has shown that there are significant gaps in representation of both users and tweets relating
 	to historically underserved communities. These gaps, known as data shadows, are critical to
	identify in order to equitably serving all communities in the city.</p>
